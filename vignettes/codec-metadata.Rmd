## Introduction

### Metadata

Metadata is information *about* data, but does not contain the data itself. For example, a CSV file cannot tell R (or other software) anything about itself including:

- general information like its name, title, description, or homepage
- how missing values are denoted
- column names, titles, types, formats, and constraints
- specific CSV "dialect" characteristics required to read it (e.g. encoding, quoting)

CODEC utilizes a specific set of standards to store community-level data in an effort to make them more interoperable and reusable.

### Frictionless Standards

[Frictionless](https://frictionlessdata.io/) standards are a set of [patterns](https://specs.frictionlessdata.io/) for describing data, including datasets, files, and tables. These metadata are contained in a specific file (separate from the data file), usually written in JSON or YAML, that describes something specific to each Frictionless Standard.

The CODEC metadata standards are based on the Frictionless [Tabular Data Resource](https://specs.frictionlessdata.io/tabular-data-resource/) standards (often written as 'tabular-data-resource' and abbreviated throughout the package as `tdr`), which is composed of three Frictionless standards:

1. [Data Resource](https://specs.frictionlessdata.io/data-resource/): describes an exact tabular file providing a path to the file and details like name, title, description, and more
2. [Table Schema](https://specs.frictionlessdata.io/table-schema/): describes a tabular file by providing its dimension, field data types, relations, and constraints
3. [CSV dialect](https://specs.frictionlessdata.io/csv-dialect/): describes the various dialects of CSV files, including terminator strings, quoting rules, escape rules, etc.

A tabular-data-resource consists of (1) a *single* table of data in a CSV file and (2) its metadata, represented as a hierarchical list in a specific format.  On disk, this metadata is stored as a YAML file and in R, it is stored in the attributes of a data.frame (or tibble).
^[This is a good place to note that although not used here, the [Data Package](https://specs.frictionlessdata.io/data-package/) & [Tabular Data Package](https://specs.frictionlessdata.io/tabular-data-package/) are similar to the Data Resource and Tabular Data Resource, except that they describe a *collection* of tabular files.]

## CODEC Metadata Standards

> *Language:* The keywords “MUST”, “MUST NOT”, “SHOULD”, “SHOULD NOT”, and “MAY” in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC 2119](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2119).

> CODEC standards are versioned with {CODECtools}, so this vignette describes version `r packageVersion("CODECtools")`.

### Tabular-Data-Resource Metadata

The metadata of a CODEC tabular-data-resource is hierarchically composed of different **descriptors** :

![](codec_metadata.png)

- **property** (or ["metadata property"](https://specs.frictionlessdata.io/data-resource/#metadata-properties)) are named values used to describe the data resource. The value of most *properties* are a single character string (e.g., `name = "my_data"`), but some are lists.

- **schema** (or ["table schema"](https://specs.frictionlessdata.io/table-schema/)) is a special *property* that is a list of information about the **fields** (or columns) in a tabular-data-resource. *schema* includes a list of *fields*, as well as the value used to denote missingness and which *fields* are primary or foreign keys.

- **fields** (or ["field descriptors"](https://specs.frictionlessdata.io/table-schema/#field-descriptors)) are a special *schema descriptor* that is a list of each of the *fields* in a tabular-data-resource, each with different *descriptors* containing *field*-specific information.

- **dialect** (or ["CSV dialect"](https://specs.frictionlessdata.io/csv-dialect/)) is another special *property* that stores information about the formatting of the data CSV file. The [CODEC data standards](codec-data.html#codec-data-standards) require specific **dialect** values so that the `dialect` descriptor is not required for a CODEC tabular-data-resource.

A CODEC tabular-data-resource MUST contain `name` and `path` descriptors. All other properties, schema, and fields MAY be present, but MUST be one of:

```{r as.is = T, echo = F}
CODECtools::codec_tdr() |>
  purrr::map(tibble::enframe) |>
  tibble::enframe(name = "type", value = "data") |>
  dplyr::rowwise(type) |>
  dplyr::summarize(data) |>
  knitr::kable()
```


All fields in the CSV data file MUST be described in the metadata and vice-versa.

### Examples

An example CODEC tabular-data-resource looks like:

```yaml
name: tract_poverty
path: tract_poverty.csv
title: Fraction of Census Tract Households in Poverty
version: 1.2.1
description: measures derived from 5-yr 2019 American Community Survey
schema:
  fields:
    census_tract_id:
      name: census_tract_id
      title: Census Tract
      description: 2010 vintage census tract identifier
      type: string
    fraction_poverty:
      name: fraction_poverty
      title: Fraction of Households in Poverty
      type: number
```
