## Creating a tabular-data-resource

Inside R, metadata lives in the attributes of the data.frame and its columns. We can add and change these with several helper functions used in the example below: `add_attrs()`, `add_col_attrs()`, `add_type_attrs()`. Using these functions to set attributes in R means we can do so reproducibly and changes to the metadata are tracked alongside the R script that creates the data. This prevents a disconnect between data and metadata, but also allows for computing on the metadata to use it to create richer documentation. ^[Alternatively, we can edit the metadata yaml file directly and track changes there.  Reading the data CSV file back in to R using a function that also reads metadata (`read_tdr_csv()`) will update the attributes of the data.frame based on changes in the metadata file.]

### Creating data

We will create a simple dataset here for this example:

```{r}
d <-
  tibble::tibble(
    id = c("A01", "A02", "A03"),
    date = as.Date(c("2022-07-25", "2018-07-10", "2013-08-15")),
    measure = c(12.8, 13.9, 15.6),
    rating = factor(c("good", "best", "best"), levels = c("good", "better", "best")),
    ranking = as.integer(c(14, 17, 19)),
    impt = c(FALSE, TRUE, TRUE)
  )
```

### Adding metadata

When creating a tabular dataset in R, data-specific metadata (i.e., "properties") can be stored in the attributes of the R object (e.g., a data.frame or tibble).

```{r}
d <- d |>
  add_attrs(
    name = "mydata",
    title = "My Data",
    version = "0.1.0",
    homepage = "https://geomarker.io/CODECtools"
  )
```

Note that this doesn't change any of the data values. In R, an object's attributes are stored with it as a list. Some attributes (`?attributes`) are treated specially by R (e.g., `class`, `names`, `row.names`, `comment`) and usually shouldn't be modified.  Although *all* attributes (including the ones we added above) are available as a list (`?attributes`), we can use a function to extract only the attributes that represent metadata descriptors as a tibble.

```{r}
glimpse_attr(d) |>
 knitr::kable()
```

Similarly, we can add column-specific attributes (i.e., "schema"). These metadata functions follow the tidy design principles, making it simple to expressively and concisely add metadata using pipes:

```{r}
d <-
  d |>
  add_col_attrs(id, title = "Identifier", description = "unique identifier") |>
  add_col_attrs(date, title = "Date", description = "date of observation") |>
  add_col_attrs(measure, title = "Measure", description = "measured quantity") |>
  add_col_attrs(rating, title = "Rating", description = "ordered ranking of observation") |>
  add_col_attrs(ranking, title = "Ranking", description = "rank of the observation") |>
  add_col_attrs(impt, title = "Important", description = "true if this observation is important")
```

Automatically add `name`, `type` and `enum` schema to each column in the data based on their class:

```{r}
d <- add_type_attrs(d)
```

Like for descriptors, there is a helper function to retrieve schema as a tibble: 

```{r}
options(knitr.kable.NA = "")
glimpse_schema(d) |>
  knitr::kable()
```

### Writing to disk

Once metadata is set in the tibble's attributes, we can save the tabular data resource as a CSV file with an accompanying tabular-data-resource.yaml:

```{r}
write_tdr_csv(d)
``` 

The `name` attribute of the supplied tibble is used as the name of a newly created folder *and* CSV file containing the data. Metadata extracted from the supplied tibble's attributes is saved in a `tabular-data-resource.yaml` file that lives alongside the data file in the newly created directory:

```{r}
fs::dir_tree("mydata")
```

Additionally, the `profile` is set to `tabular-data-resource` and included in the metadata. This allows for reading, modifying, and writing tabular-data-resources with other software as well.

## Reading a tabular-data-resource

Since the `tabular-data-resource.yaml` file defines the relative location of the CSV data file in the `path` attribute, specifying this file is enough to read a tabular-data-resource from disk and restore its attributes and column classes in R:

```{r}
mydata <- read_tdr_csv(tdr_file = fs::path("mydata", "tabular-data-resource.yaml"))
mydata
```

```{r, include = FALSE}
fs::dir_delete("mydata")
```

If the `tdr_file` is a URL, then the tabular-data-resource and CSV data files are automatically downloaded first:

```{r}
lndcvr <-
  read_tdr_csv( "https://github.com/geomarker-io/hamilton_landcover/releases/download/v0.1.0/tabular-data-resource.yaml")
```

```{r}
glimpse_attr(lndcvr) |>
  knitr::kable()
```

```{r}
glimpse_schema(lndcvr) |>
  knitr::kable()
```
